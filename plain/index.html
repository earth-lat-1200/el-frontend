                    <p> As the earth rotates we can see the virtual movement of the sun across the sky. The aim of the
                        project Earth L.A.T. 12:00 is to visualize this movement.<br>
                    <p>The local apparent time (LAT) 12:00 is defined as the time the sun appears on the local south
                        meridian – at which point the sun is located directly above / the suns station is at its
                        south-most point. Sundials show LAT by the moving shadow. They are a measure of time since
                        thousands of years.</p>
                    <p> Our goal is to produce a 24/7 live video stream of shadows crossing the 12:00 line all over the
                        world. Every few minutes the live stream switches to the next sundial – so one can follow LAT
                        12:00 as the earth rotates and to get a real sense of our spinning globe.</p>
                    <p>Anyone can start a sundial which is basically a stick casting a shadow on a flat surface. The
                        hardware required to do this could be e.g. a RaspberryPI+Cam (U$ 100 + U$ 5/month for transfer
                        costs). The system also has to be correctly set up and programmed. The images are then
                        transferred via FTP to the server, which automatically selects the displayed image.</p>

                    <p>We stand on a globe which is rotating around its own axis and which is orbiting the sun (that's
                        common sense - but there are some people who are not sure about it). Because the earth is that
                        huge in relation to our bodies and most of our direct environment - desks, trees, houses,
                        mountains, rivers, etc. - which takes the same movement as us we we hardly realize the rotation.
                    </p>
                    <p>Yes, we can figure out the rotation by numbers: The earth has a diameter of some 12 700 km/7 900
                        mi; one 360° rotation takes 23 h 56 min 04 sec; it takes a year for one orbit around the sun; at
                        the equator the rotation speed is supersonic and at the pole it is zero.</p>
                    <p>But this numbers will not really give us the sense.</p>
                    <p>Let's take a telescope, fix it to the ground and look through it straight to the sky. The Saturn
                        stays almost still in space within this short period of time - just the telescope moves by the
                        rotation of the earth. What we can see is this: <img src="./saturn1.gif" width="300"
                            class="pull-right"></p>
                    <p>You need to have a telescope to be able to realize the movement - or this site.</p>
                    <p>You can view this rotation by watching moving shadows caused by moving light sources. This
                        appears to us as a moving shadow cast by a stick fixed in position illuminated by a moving light
                        source. I fact, however, it is the sun which is stationary and the stick, which is attached to
                        the surface of the earth, that is moving.</p>
                    <p>We can observe something like this:</p>
                    <p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KKkzwlrfFI0" width="400" frameborder="0"
                            allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
                    <p>It is precisely this movement that we want to show. To give you a live imagination of sundials
                        around the world - each of them displays 12:00 L.A.T. in real time. After a few minutes
                        automatically the live view switches to the next-westerly sundial. With enought partners
                        worldwide you can watch sundials 24 h per day/7 days a week each showing high noon at their
                        respective location.</p>
