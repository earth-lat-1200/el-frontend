            <div class="panel">
                <p> As the earth rotates we can see the virtual movement of the sun across the sky. The aim of the
                    project Earth L.A.T. 12:00 is to visualize this movement.<br>
                <p>The local apparent time (LAT) 12:00 is defined as the time the sun appears on the local south
                    meridian – at which point the sun is located directly above / the suns station is at its
                    south-most point. Sundials show LAT by the moving shadow. They are a measure of time since
                    thousands of years.</p>
                <p> Our goal is to produce a 24/7 live video stream of shadows crossing the 12:00 line all over the
                    world. Every few minutes the live stream switches to the next sundial – so one can follow LAT
                    12:00 as the earth rotates and to get a real sense of our spinning globe.</p>
                <p>Anyone can start a sundial which is basically a stick casting a shadow on a flat surface. The
                    hardware required to do this could be e.g. a RaspberryPI+Cam (U$ 100 + U$ 5/month for transfer
                    costs). The system also has to be correctly set up and programmed. The images are then
                    transferred via FTP to the server, which automatically selects the displayed image.</p>

            <button class="accordion"><h3>Watch the Rotating Earth - How?</h3></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>We stand on a globe which is rotating around its own axis and which is orbiting the sun (that's
                    common sense - but there are some people who are not sure about it). Because the earth is that
                    huge in relation to our bodies and most of our direct environment - desks, trees, houses,
                    mountains, rivers, etc. - which takes the same movement as us we we hardly realize the rotation.
                </p>
                <p>Yes, we can figure out the rotation by numbers: The earth has a diameter of some 12 700 km/7 900
                    mi; one 360° rotation takes 23 h 56 min 04 sec; it takes a year for one orbit around the sun; at
                    the equator the rotation speed is supersonic and at the pole it is zero.</p>
                <p>But this numbers will not really give us the sense.</p>
                <p>Let's take a telescope, fix it to the ground and look through it straight to the sky. The Saturn
                    stays almost still in space within this short period of time - just the telescope moves by the
                    rotation of the earth. What we can see is this: <br> <img src="./resources/saturn.gif" width="300"
                        class="pull-right"></p>
                <p>You need to have a telescope to be able to realize the movement - or this site.</p>
                <p>You can view this rotation by watching moving shadows caused by moving light sources. This
                    appears to us as a moving shadow cast by a stick fixed in position illuminated by a moving light
                    source. I fact, however, it is the sun which is stationary and the stick, which is attached to
                    the surface of the earth, that is moving.</p>
                <p>We can observe something like this:</p>
                <p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KKkzwlrfFI0" style="margin: auto;" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0"
                        allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
                <p>It is precisely this movement that we want to show. To give you a live imagination of sundials
                    around the world - each of them displays 12:00 L.A.T. in real time. After a few minutes
                    automatically the live view switches to the next-westerly sundial. With enought partners
                    worldwide you can watch sundials 24 h per day/7 days a week each showing high noon at their
                    respective location.</p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>The project is driven by a non-profit organization. Founder and head of this organization is Kurt
                    Niel, Grieskirchen, Austria. He is lecturer at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria
                    and holds a professorship in industrial machine vision, and is head of the department metrology
                    and control engineering. Topics in astronomy and sundials are his beside interests.</p>
                <p>Further part time members deal with website design and implementation (Michael Mayrhofer, Julian
                    Zeilinger, HTL Grieskirchen), and public relations with upper Austrian schools or international
                    social media channels.</p>
                <p>The team as “ARGE Earth LAT 1200” (Barbara Egger, Klaus Aigner, Josef Doppelbauer, HTL
                    Grieskirchen and Kurt Niel) is granted a promotion by the Upper Austrian and Austrian government
                    including grants from the European Union. This grant is used for promotion in social media
                    channels and production of information material.</p>
